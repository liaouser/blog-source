Sunday 18 September

Today is the weekend. A full week has happened. This is the first week. I met my new classmates and teachers. And I made a lot of friends.

The first week was happy and exciting. There were a lot of things waiting for me to do. And I completed the things successfully. 

I was not bored during the English lesson,because English is my favorite project. I introduced myself during the English lesson. I was proud of myself.

After class,I like playing basketball with my classmates. They are highly skilled. But I just want to learn to them.

One day,I went to the library to read books. A boy sat down next to me. I found that we had the same hobbies,I glad to talk with him. Since then we have become close friends.
