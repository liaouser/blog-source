When I came to school,I was very curious. The teachers and  classmates are very friendly. I saw them clearing. At night, we read books and wrote homework. We laughing and played after class. They made a good impression on me. But I am nervous. Maybe we once knew. All in all, we will get on each other,Learn together. I will be my best. I hope I will get a high mark
