In the end, today is Saturday. I completed my first week. I claim my first week is full and funny.
I felt my new school was good-looking. There are a lot of plants there, such as trees and flowers.
My classroom was really spacious. The teachers and classmates are friendly. When I got in trouble, they always helped me solve the problem.

 

Everyone was quiet during the class. The classmates listened intently to the teacher's lessons. All the students were taking careful notes. After school, I played badminton with Jack. Jack is my best friend. We met in the library on Wednesday. Since then, we are inseparable.
